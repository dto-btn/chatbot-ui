Make sure your preferred editor is also set up to use Flutter.

(For example if using VSCode, install the Flutter extension)

## Setting Up the Flutter project/application

VSCode: Go to the pubspec.yaml file and get the necessary packages/dependencies by clicking the "Get Packages" button near the top-right corner of screen. Then start debugging.

Console: Make sure the inner folder of the project is selected. Then run these two commands:
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

It will ask which device you want to open the application with. Select your preferred device.
